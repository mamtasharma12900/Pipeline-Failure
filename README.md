# Machine Learning for Pipeline Failure Prediction and Risk Mitigation

This is a machine learning project aimed at enabling a pipeline repairs company to accurately predict pipeline failures and proactively identify pipelines at risk. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the project aims to minimize downtime and associated costs by addressing potential issues before they lead to significant damages.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify pipelines at risk of failure. By establishing a risk threshold, indicated by an 80% likelihood of failure, immediate action can be taken to prevent accidents or further damage.

## Features

- Predictive pipeline failure analysis using machine learning algorithms
- Risk threshold identification for proactive risk management
- Rigorous evaluation of multiple machine learning models using cross-validation techniques
- Data retrieval directly from a PostgreSQL database
